                <h2>My Mentor: Sadie Valerie</h2>
                <p>My artistic growth has been deeply influenced by my mentor, <strong>Sadie Valerie</strong>, a respected artist in the classical community. Sadie has been a guiding force in my artistic development, providing invaluable insight into technique, composition, and the philosophy behind classical art. Her attention to detail and passion for preserving traditional methods have been a constant inspiration to me. I also take after Juliette Aristedes as I train with her several books.</p>
